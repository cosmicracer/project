The Mercedes-Benz 190 SL roadster saw the light of day in the year 1955 impersonating a less expensive and less advanced alternative for the 300 SL roadster. Technically the 190 SL roadster shared nothing with big brother 300 SL. But the bodywork design and interior design, which appealed to many people, were strongly inspired by the 300 SL roadster. The Mercedes-Benz 190 SL was a real touring-convertible in opposite to the 300 SL roadster which was a true sports car.
But the 190 SL was affordable (to Mercedes-Benz standards) and the car found a great share of enthusiastic owners primarily in the sunny states of the USA. The sales success of the 190 SL was based on the good looks of the car but also because of the excellent comfort, the excellent mechanics and its reliability. 
The Mercedes-Benz 190 SL was equipped with a four-cylinder engine with a cylinder capacity of 1897 cc. and fitted with two carburettors. The standard four-speed manual gearbox was fully synchronized and featured floor shift. From 1956 on the 190 SL was fitted with standard power brakes. 
During the entire period of production a very nice hardtop was available. The story goes that many European owner ordered the roadster with the hardtop and hardly ever took it off! In the year 1963 the 190 SL was succeeded by the new Mercedes-Benz 230 SL roadster which was going to be known by the nickname "Pagoda".<br><br>

<h4>Mercedes-Benz history</h4>

The early years

Mercedes-Benz was formed in 1926 by the merger of car manufacturers Daimler and Benz. The founders of both firms, Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz, were motoring pioneers who presented their first vehicles powered by internal combustion 4-stroke engines in the years 1886 - 1889. 
Daimler first introduced a motorcycle and Benz a three wheeler. Shortly after they introduced proper motorcars with four wheels but still resembling horse coaches. The compact and light Daimler engine became very popular and it was incorporated in many of the early French motor cars.
Panhard et Levassor acquired a licence to produce the Daimler engine. It can be said that with Daimler and Benz the successful industrial production of the automobile started. For the fast developments within the car industry however the French are responsible. For the French pioneers racing was a means to improve the breed.
The early town to town races were many times won by Daimler or Benz cars or French cars using a Daimler engine. Mr. Emil Jellinek of Nice was to play an important role in the sales and development of Daimler cars. Jellinek appreciated the quality of the Daimler products and so he set up dealerships in Nice an Paris. 
His ideas were incorporated in the Daimler cars by Daimler and his genius assistant Karl Maybach. Perfectionist Jellinek was a real nuisance to the Daimler firm but he was their largest customer by far. Maybach and Jellinek understood each other perfectly and their synergy lead to that would be the inspiration of all manufacturers and all automobiles to follow, the Mercedes car named after Jellineks daughter. 
The Mercedes of 1901 featured a proper steel chassis, a front mounted four cylinder engine, a raked steering column and a proper steering wheel. The Mercedes was the car to have for the European rich and famous who assembled in Nice during the ‘Speed Week’, of course Emil Jellinek was one the moving spirits behind this yearly event and he cleverly sold a lot af cars in the process. 
The Mercedes cars were also very succesful in the French Grand Prix races. Lautenschlager won the 1908 edition in Dieppe with Hemery and Hanriot second and third on 150 HP Benz cars. In 1909 Hemery was the first to break the 200 km/h mark with the Lightning Benz (Blitzen Benz) at the Brooklands race course in England. 
In 1911 a Blitzen Benz driven by Bob Burman at Daytona Beach broke the absolute land speed record with 228,1 km/h. In 1914 Mercedes again won the French Grand prix with Lautenschlager again being the victor.
